### **_Description_**

#### artFolio is a artwork database. It allows artists to share their artwork, biographical information, and contact information with other artists and art buyers. Each artFolio is managed by that independent artist and they can post new artwork, update information about themselves or their artwork, and delete artwork and/or information.
